# Smart Key Locker

A lightweight, system-tray based application for Windows to lock your keyboard and mouse input, preventing unintended actions. It can be triggered manually via a hotkey or automatically after a period of inactivity

### âœ¨ Features

*   **System Tray Control**: Runs silently in the system tray, showing the current status with its icon (ðŸŸ¢ Unlocked / ðŸ”´ Locked).
*   **Hotkey Lock & Unlock**: Use customizable global hotkeys to instantly lock (Default: `Ctrl+Alt+L`) and securely unlock (Default: `Ctrl+Alt+P`) your inputs.
*   **Auto-Lock Timer**: Automatically locks the screen if there's no mouse or keyboard activity for a set duration.
*   **Total Input Blocking**: When locked, all keyboard presses and mouse actions are completely blocked.
*   **Easy Configuration**: A simple right-click menu provides access to a settings panel where you can change hotkeys and the inactivity timeout.
